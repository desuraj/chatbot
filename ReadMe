AI Based Chatbot for College Related Queries were motivated by the need 
of traditional websites to provide a chat facility, where a bot is required to 
be able to chat with user and solve queries. 
When live agent can handle only two to three operations at a time, chatbots 
can operate without an upper limit which really scales up the operations. 
Also, if any school or business is receiving lots of queries, having a chatbot 
on a website takes off the load also improves the responses rate compared 
support team.
Chatbot can automate the repetitive tasks. There can be some scenarios 
where a business or school receives same queries in a day for many times 
and support team must respond to each query repetitively. The most 
important advantage of having a chatbot is that it is available 24/7. No 
matter what time it is, a user can get a query solved.
On current scenario, Chatbots will be handling 85% of the customer service 
interactions by the year 2020. Also, 80% of businesses are expected to have 
some sort of chatbot automation by 2020.
In this project we used Agile SDLC model which shows the combination 
of iterative and incremental process.
The project was working on HTML, CSS, JavaScript as main frontend 
technology and deep learning, python, tensor flow as backend technology. 
Flask is used as web technology.
